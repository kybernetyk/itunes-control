The simple and really dumb IC protocol:

well it's just plain dumb strings. atm supported:

none <- no operation. send this if there's no controll message in queue
stop <- stops playback
pause <- pauses playback
play <- starts/resumes playback
next <- jump to next track in playlist
prev <- jump to previous track in playlist
vol_dec <- decreases the volume by 10 units (out of 100 which is max vol)
vol_inc <- increases the volume by 10 units
mute_unmute <- toggles mute

don't send any http/html data. just the words.
